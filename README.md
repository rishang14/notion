i have to update in like this lots of hurdle and how i am approachiing it is pretty decent i would love to share more .  


• uplaoding banner by using suprabase  

•currently there is lot of learning curve in this project like a lot most of the imp thing like handling race condition and all and also i am using in memory for the user in room and socket sotring it is wrong have to use redis but it is learning project so i am skipping it
